This is react project created with create-react-app module

## Available Scripts

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## About the App
This is a basic app that facilitates a recruiter to view all the candidates that applied for the job accessing their respective CVs and can make a comment as well.

## Technologies Used

I used React Bootstrap framework for styling  the U-I. I have used it for several projects and its awesome!
axios package to make requests to the server,

## Improvements
There are a lot of improvements I would wish to make in this project for example:

1. validations i.e form
2. using the real developed apis,
3. uploading of CVs
4. Rating the candidate based on what is entailed in the CV, for example to determine the kind of interviews..

## What to do Different

Given time, I would expound on this project; use the dashboard and make it applicable in real-life.
